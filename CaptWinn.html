The Winn House is named after Captain
James Winn who came from a sea-faring family.&nbsp; He was born in
1808 and was the son of James Winn and Philadelphia Maxwell.&nbsp;
In 1846 the Winn family launched a 161&#8211;ton brig out of Kennebunkport
with Captain James at the helm.&nbsp; After several trips he
succumbed to an illness that was aboard the vessel and died at the New
York Marine Hospital.

After analysis by experts, the house was determined to have been built
around 1780 probably by James Winn Sr.&nbsp; The analysis also
showed evidence of an early 19<sup>th</sup> century restoration.&nbsp; The
central staircase and the front door were added at that time.&nbsp;
The house is built around a central chimney with four
fireplaces.&nbsp; Its other features include wide floor boards,
feather board paneling, interior shutters in the back room, original
windows and a beautiful federal staircase and mantel.&nbsp;
Remarkably. through two hundred years of owners and tenants nothing has
changed the integrity 
of its original architectural
beginnings.&nbsp; The 
house which formerly stood on&nbsp;Route
One north

of the village was donated to the town by Phyllis Perkins and was moved
to Jacobs Field by the Rotary Club.&nbsp; Committees were formed
and volunteers from the town scraped, painted and researched the
building.&nbsp; In 2001, both the house and the Dorothea Jacobs
Grant Park became a reality.&nbsp; During the original move, &quot;the&nbsp;
ell&quot;&nbsp;or addition to the side of the house became separated
from the main structure.&nbsp; A plan was drawn with the exact
measurements taken from the original building.&nbsp; In 2005, a new
ell was completed and added to the restored house.&nbsp; The
addition houses the Littlefield Genealogical Library and is used for
meetings and educational activities. Future projects include
restoration of the fireplaces and the upstairs rooms.
