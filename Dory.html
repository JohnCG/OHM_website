In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, boat building varied along the Atlantic Coast
depending on the ocean, the livelihood of the fishermen and the
preferences of local boat builders.&nbsp; The famous Ogunquit Dory
was unique to its own village.&nbsp; Ogunquit dories accommodated
the rocky coast and strong tides.&nbsp; They were built for
trawling and lobstering and varied in length from about 16 feet to
about 21 feet.&nbsp; In the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century, fishermen and
schooners plied their trade along the Ogunquit River.&nbsp;
Fishermen&#39;s shacks and wharves were dotted along what is still today
named Wharf Lane.&nbsp; Among these small buildings was the boat
house of William Henry Perkins.&nbsp; In his youth, William Henry
had gone to sea on a fishing schooner.&nbsp; While fishing along
the Grand Banks, William Henry became familiar with the banks
dory.&nbsp; The flared straight sides of the banks dory permitted
these boats to be stacked inside one another, and when necessary they
could be hoisted in and out of the schooner.&nbsp; When William
Henry&#39;s group of dories was fishing, his dory became separated from the
others in the fog.&nbsp; Miraculously he made his way back to
Halifax and then back to Ogunquit where he began to build
dories.&nbsp; Consequently, his dories had a bow and stern similar
to the banks dory but they had a very wide middle section (beam)
typical of the local fishing vessels.&nbsp; This extra space
allowed room for lobster traps or extra trawling equipment necessary
for offshore work.&nbsp; They were sturdy vessels that Ogunquit&#39;s
fishermen used well into the 19<sup>th</sup> century until they gradually
disappeared.&nbsp; Because these dories are legendary and are a
part of our coastal history, we yearned to duplicate one of
them.&nbsp; After much research and labor, our duplicate dory was
built and launched in 2008.&nbsp; It now resides either in front of
the Museum or moored in Perkins Cove.
